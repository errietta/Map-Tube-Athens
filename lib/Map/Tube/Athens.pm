=head1 INFORMATION

What I found out was that it's surprisingly difficult to find an up-to-date, accurate map of the Athens Metro. It seemed that the best source was actually a volunteer-made map from Wikipedia: L<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Athens_Metro_Map_%28December_2013%2C_English%29.svg>.

If you can read Greek, there's also L<http://www.ypodomes.com/media/k2/items/cache/12a344790c511a0cdcacaded32f8a413_XL.jpg>.
